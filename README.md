# MCProf #

`MCProf` is a memory and communication profiler. It traces memory reads/writes and reports memory accesses by various functions in the application as well as the data-communication between functions.  `MCProf` relies on [Intel Pin](www.pintool.org) dynamic binary instrumentation framework.

# A picture is worth a thousand words #
Consider the following `C` code snippet in which some operations are performed on some arrays.

```c
#define SIZE 5000
int *srcArr1, *srcArr2, *sumArr, *diffArr;

void test(int count) {
    printf("Call number %d to test()\n",count);
    if(count)
        test(count-1);
    else
        return;
}

void initVecs() {
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < nElem; i++) {
        srcArr1[i]=i*5 + 7;
        srcArr2[i]=2*i - 3;
    }
}

void sumVecs() {
    int i;
    initVecs();
    for(i = 0; i < nElem; i++) {
        sumArr[i] = srcArr1[i] + coeff * srcArr2[i];
    }
    initVecs();
}

void diffVecs()
{
    int i;
    test(3);
    for(i = 0; i < nElem; i++) {
        diffArr[i] = coeff * (srcArr1[i] - srcArr2[i]);
    }
}

void process()
{
    initVecs();
    sumVecs();
    diffVecs();
}

int main() {
    srcArr1 = malloc( SIZE*sizeof(int) );
    //simmilarly, other allocations

    int i;
    for(i=0; i<3; i++)
        process();

    printf("output : %d\n",sumArr[1]+diffArr[2]);

    free(srcArr1);
    // simmilarly, other memory frees
    return 0;
}
```

A traditional output generated by MCProf is the application [call graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) as shown in figure below.

The following figure shows the communication graph generated by `MCProf`. Ovals represent the functions in the application whereas allocated objects are represented by squares.

This README file briefly explains the process of setting up `MCProf` and start generating such graphs for C/C++ applications.

## Supported Patforms

`MCProf` relies on Intel Pin, so it can be used on any 64-bit Linux platform for which Pin is available. We have used `MCProf` on 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04 on real machines as well as virtual machines running in virtualbox.


## Download

`MCProf` can be downloaded [from](https://bitbucket.org/imranashraf/mcprof/downloads).

## Required Packages

In order to setup and use `MCProf` the following packages are required:

* [Intel Pin DBI framework](www.pintool.org) Revision 62732 or higher
* g++ compiler with C++ 11 support
* libelf library to read static symbols from the binary
* graphviz Dot utility for converting the generated communication graphs from dot to pdf, png etc
* gnuplot to plot communication matrix as graph

## Setup

`MCProf` uses Makefile to compile the sources. In order to compile `MCProf` from sources on 32-bit / 64-bit Linux, the following steps can be performed.

* Download Pin and copy and extract it to the directory where you want to keep Pin.

* Define a variable `PIN_ROOT` by running the following commands:

        export PIN_ROOT=/<path to pin>

* Add Pin to your path by the following command:

        export PATH=$PIN_ROOT:$PATH

* You can also add these lines, for instance, to your `.bashrc` in case you are using `bash` to export these variable automatically on opening a terminal.

* Download `MCProf` and copy and extract it to the directory where you want to compile it.

* Go the `MCProf` directory and run the following command to compile it:

        make

If every thing goes fine, you will see `mcprof.so` in `obj-intel64` direcoty (or `obj-ia32` directory depending upon your architecture).

## Usage
`MCProf` usage is explained here for the given tests available in `test` directory as well as a standalone application.

#### Running Given Test Examples
Various test examples are available in `tests` directory inside `MCProf`. These tests are also compiled to binaries with the compilation process and are available as executables in obj-intel64/obj-ia32 directory. In order to run `MCProf` for one of these tests (e.g. vecOps.cpp) you can run (from the `MCProf` directory) the following command:

    make vecOps.test

This will create `communication.dot` file which can be converted to pdf file by the following command:

    dot -Tpdf communication.dot -o communication.pdf
    
A script `dot2pdf.sh` is also provided in the `scripts` directory which can also be used to convert the graphs in `dot` format to `pdf` format. This script also performs some extra tasks, for instance, remove unconnected nodes in the graph. This script can be used as:

    <path to mcprof dir>/scripts/dot2pdf.sh

#### Profiling your own application
In order to use `MCProf` to analyze your application, you should compile your application with  `-g -O1 -fno-inline` compiler flags. For instance if the name of your application binary is`yourAppBinary` then you can use `MCProf` as:

    /<path to pin dir>/pin -t <path to mcprof dir>/obj-intel64/mcprof.so -- <path to your binary>/<yourAppBinary>

This generates `communication.dot` file which can be converted to pdf (or some other formats of your interest) for visualization.

To simplify this process and give a complete example, a test application containing the `makefile` showing the complete process is available in `tests/yourApp` example. Feel free to copy it to any place you like and modify the paths in the first two lines to point to Pin and path to `MCProf` directory. After this, you can compile this application and profile it by `MCProf` by the following command:

    make mcprof


## Detailed Documentation

Detailed documentation of `MCProf` with input options and outputs generated can be found in the [manual](https://bitbucket.org/imranashraf/mcprof/raw/master/doc/manual.pdf) available in the  [doc](https://bitbucket.org/imranashraf/mcprof/raw/master/doc) directory.
